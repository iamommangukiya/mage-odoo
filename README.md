# Skill Swap

## 🚀 Problem Statement

In collaborative and project-based environments, individuals often have diverse skill sets but limited exposure to other domains. **Skill Swap** addresses this gap by providing a platform where team members can **exchange knowledge and skills** with each other. This not only promotes personal growth but also strengthens team synergy and productivity.
